# Hospital_Data_Analysis

This project analyzes key hospital performance metrics — including spending, readmission rates, mortality rates, and patient experience — to understand how different factors relate to overall hospital quality. The goal is to identify patterns, surface meaningful insights, and demonstrate skills in exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data storytelling.

Project Overview

In this project, I:

- Worked with a synthetic dataset representing hospital-level performance metrics

- Cleaned and explored the data to understand its structure

- Visualized relationships between spending, outcomes, and patient experience

- Identified patterns that can help hospitals improve efficiency and quality

- Summarized actionable insights and recommendations

This project represents the type of analysis I’d perform in healthcare or insurance settings where operational and outcome data guide strategic decisions.


Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights:

- Pandas for data cleaning and exploration

- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

- Correlation analysis for understanding relationships

- Feature comparison and segmentation

- Storytelling through data to surface insights that matter to hospital operations

- Ability to turn an open-ended dataset into a structured analysis

Key Insights

Based on the analysis:

- Higher hospital spending does not consistently result in better outcomes.

- Patient experience has a clearer relationship with readmission and mortality performance.

- Performance varies significantly across hospitals and states, suggesting internal practices matter more than geography.

- Improving hospital quality requires focus on efficiency, coordinated care, and patient-centered processes — not just increased spending.

Visualizations Included

The notebook includes:

- Distributions of spending, readmissions, mortality, and experience scores

- Scatterplots of spending vs. outcomes

- A correlation heatmap of all performance metrics

- State-level comparisons
